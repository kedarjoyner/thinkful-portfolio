alt: two criss-crossed light sabers
overview: Another project during my time at Thinkful was to create an interactive quiz with a focus on using JavaScript objects. I created the project in three phases which included a wireframe, static build, and then a final working version of my application.
challenges: This was my most challenging project, because I decided to move beyond the assignment requirements and add another layer of complexity by creating two quizzes in one, more questions, and a dynamic design. The user is able to choose quiz questions centered around either light-force characters or dark-force characters. Which side of the force are you on?
frameworks: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
