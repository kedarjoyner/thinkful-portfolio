overview: As a Frontend Dev student at Thinkful, I was asked to code a shopping list app from scratch. First, I created a detailed wireframe so that I had a clear idea of the look and feel of my app before I started building. Secondly, I built a non-interactive version of the app that demonstrated the layout and style. As the third part of this project, I used JavaScript and JQuery to make my app interactive.
challenges: I was almost entirely on my own for this project and had to bring together everything I learned about wireframing, styling, and using JQuery to traverse the DOM and bring my app to life. After completing this project, I decided to recreate my app a second time in order to refractor my code and better understand jQuery.
frameworks: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
