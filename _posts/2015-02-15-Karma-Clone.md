title: Website Clone

overview: During my time at Thinkful, one of my initial assignments was to clone a landing page for a company called Karma Wi-FI using only html and raw css.
challenges: I typically use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Semantic UI for faster web development, so using raw CSS was a great exercise for me. I struggled with box models and positioning, but found myself quickly enjoying the process of learning more about CSS layouts. Since Karma Clone, I've advanced further and integrated Sass into my everyday workflow and often mentor other students in layout design.
frameworks: HTML & CSS
