overview: During my time at Thinkful, one of my initial assignments was to clone a landing page of a company's website called Karma Wi-FI using only html and raw css.
challenges: I typically use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Semantic UI for faster web development, so using raw CSS was a great exercise for me. I struggled with box models and positioning, but found myself utilizing valuable skills to solve these obstacles, such as google dev tools, inspecting source code, and rubber ducking (a lot). Since the Karma Clone project, I've advanced further and integrated Sass into my everyday workflow and often mentor other students in layout design.
