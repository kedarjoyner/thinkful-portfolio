overview: As a visual storyteller, Iâ€™m in love with the everyday things that often go unnoticed - moments that make life special, like holding hands or dancing on a frozen lake. Even the smallest, most ordinary moments are worth remembering, and I love to help people and small businesses capture them. Photography has also been my gateway into graphic design, multi-media, and now web development. It's helped give me the skills to build websites with a focus on functional design and create powerful content that matters.
challenges: In the beginning, it was difficult to navigate the lifestyle as a freelance photographer. Building a brand, client base, and grasping copyright and contract law was overwhelming. I've been successful in the business because of my organization and ability to adapt to changing styles and trends. My work has been published in Looks Like Film, Our Life, Meet My Dog, Serenify, and Madison Magazine.
frameworks:  Lightroom, Photoshop, Illustrator, inDesign, Premiere Pro
