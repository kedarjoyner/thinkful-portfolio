description: As a creative storyteller and photographer, learning graphic design was a matter of natural progression for me. More than four years ago I started attending workshops and collaborating with other artists in the area to create engaging, beautiful content. I've worked on a broad range of design projects that include website design, magazine layout, hand-lettering, corporate communications, infographics, wedding invitations, infographics, and logo creation.
