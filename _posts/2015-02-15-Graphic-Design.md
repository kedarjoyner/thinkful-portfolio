overview: As a creative storyteller and photographer, learning graphic design was a matter of natural progression for me. More than four years ago I started attending workshops and collaborating with other artists in the area to create engaging, beautiful content. I've worked on a broad range of design projects that include website design, magazine layout, hand-lettering, corporate communications, infographics, wedding invitations, infographics, and logo creation.
challenges: In March of 2015, I was lead presentation designer and photographer for Total Administrative Service Corporation's annual company meeting and awards ceremony - a 1.5 million event with 1,000 attendees. After talking with TASC about their goals for this project, they wanted a fresh look that would showcase their philanthropy and bring a youthful presence to their insurance environment. With a clean, minimalist approach we came up with a flat design and bright color palette that complimented the set design and each keynote speaker. TASC's event made the local news and management reported the highest ratings from employees to date.
frameworks: inDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, Premiere Pro
